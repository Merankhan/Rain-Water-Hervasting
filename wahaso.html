    <h3><ol><u><i>Key Components:</i></u></ol></h3>
    <p>The key components of a Wahaso rainwater harvesting system include:</p>
    <br>
    <li><b>Catchment Area:</b> Typically a roof or surface that collects rainwater.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Gutters and Downspouts:</b> Channels that direct rainwater from the catchment area into storage.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Filters: </b>  Screens or first flush devices that remove debris and contaminants from the collected rainwater.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Storage Tanks:</b> Containers used to store the harvested rainwater for later use.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Pumps:</b>  Devices that help distribute stored water to desired locations, such as irrigation systems.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Distribution System:</b>  Pipes and valves that ensure the efficient delivery of harvested water to various applications.</li>
    <br>

    <h4><u>Applications:</u></h4>
    <p>Wahaso rainwater harvesting systems have a wide range of applications that contribute to sustainability and water conservation. They provide water for **irrigation**, helping with landscaping, gardens, and agricultural needs, reducing reliance on municipal water sources. The systems can also be used for **non-potable purposes**, such as cleaning, cooling systems, and industrial processes. Rainwater harvested through Wahaso systems is commonly used for **toilet flushing**, helping to conserve potable water in homes and businesses. By storing rainwater, these systems assist in **stormwater management**, reducing runoff and preventing flooding. In times of drought or water shortages, the system serves as a reliable **emergency water supply**. Additionally, Wahasoâ€™s approach helps with overall **water conservation**, leading to lower water bills, and in some cases, can even be utilized for **fire protection** in large properties or communities.</p>

    <h3><i>Other Water Harvesting Systems:</i></h3>
    <p>Other water harvesting systems include **surface water harvesting**, which collects water from rivers, lakes, or ponds, and **groundwater harvesting**, which involves extracting water from underground aquifers. **Fog harvesting** captures moisture from fog, typically using mesh nets to collect water droplets. Each system offers unique benefits depending on local climate and water availability.</p>
