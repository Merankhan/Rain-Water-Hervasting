    <p><ul>Key Products by Barr Plastics:</ul></p>
    <p><ul>Barr Plastics manufactures various products made from durable plastic materials, often for rainwater harvesting systems, water filtration, irrigation, and drainage solutions. These products can include:</ul></p>
    <ol><li> Rainwater Harvesting Tanks</li></ol>

         <p><ul>Barr Plastics provides rainwater storage tanks that come in various sizes and materials. These tanks are designed to hold collected rainwater for later use, such as for irrigation, flushing toilets, or even potable water (if properly filtered). The tanks are made from durable plastics such as polyethylene, which is resistant to UV degradation and can withstand harsh weather conditions. They offer both above-ground and underground tanks, allowing for flexibility in installation.</ul></p>

    <br>
    <ol><li>  Pre-filtration Systems
    </li></ol>
    <p><ul>Barr Plastics offers pre-filtration systems to remove debris (like leaves, dirt, and organic matter) before the rainwater enters the storage tank. These systems often include first flush diverters, which direct the initial dirty runoff away from the storage system, ensuring cleaner water for storage. The filters help maintain water quality and prevent clogging in storage tanks.</ul></p></i></h5>
